This is Repo for demostrating various ATAP tools in the Jupyter notebook form.

Each branch consist a demo notebook for a single purpose, and these should not be merged to the main.

Some notebooks and packages are under active development hence expect changes from time to time.

Most notebooks in this repository use the common ATAP [Corpus Loader](https://github.com/Australian-Text-Analytics-Platform/atap-corpus-loader) and [Corpus Slicer](https://github.com/Australian-Text-Analytics-Platform/atap-corpus-slicer) for uploading, managing and slicing your text collection. 

Guides for using these tools can be found from the linked individual Github repos.

The following notebooks are available to test on ATAP Binderhub, a valid Australian Access Federation login is needed:
