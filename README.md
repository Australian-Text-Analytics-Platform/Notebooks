This is a demo notebook for ATAP [Juxtorpus](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/juxtorpus) tool.

The notebook and package are both in pre-release stage, more documentations, improvements and bug fixes will be added soon.

This notebook also uses the ATAP [Corpus Loader](https://github.com/Australian-Text-Analytics-Platform/atap-corpus-loader) and [Corpus Slicer](https://github.com/Australian-Text-Analytics-Platform/atap-corpus-slicer) for uploading, managing and slicing your text collection. The ATAP [Corpus Extractor](https://github.com/Australian-Text-Analytics-Platform/atap-context-extractor) and ATAP [Corpus Timeline](https://github.com/Australian-Text-Analytics-Platform/atap-corpus-timeline)) are also integrated for creating context based sub-corpus and visually explore corpus with datetime metadata.

Guides for using these tools can be found from the linked Github repos.
